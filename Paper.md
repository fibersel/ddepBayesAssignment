1)Droupout speedup using approximation weighted sum of M Bernoulli random variables with one normal disributed random variable
2)Fast dropout approximation is exact in cases, when number of features is high enougth, in other cases the speedup won't be so significant
3)Time saving comes from replacing Bernoulli variables Z_i in monte-carlo approximation of gradient with one normal distributed variable
4)I don't think so, because it looks strange and illogically
